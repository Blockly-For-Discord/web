## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find out about any vulnerability that violates the terms of service, is a threat to security or privacy for you or other users please do under NO circumstances write about it in a Github Issues post. 
Instead send an email to **support@blockly-for-discord.xyz**
or
write a DM to one of the Lead Developers on our Discord Server

Ideally do both, and with the following information:
- What happens?
- Expected Behaviour?
- What privacy or vulnerability can or is being exploited?
- What steps to reproduce?
