# Blockly For Discord

Blockly for Discord is a project we made to build Discord Bots with simple blocks, so you dont have to touch a line of code. All of your blocks then can get translated to either DiscordJS or Discord.py .

## How it works

The entire project is made with pure JS and as the name of the site suggest we use Google's open source **Blockly** project to imitate Scratch-Blocks on an open workspace.
